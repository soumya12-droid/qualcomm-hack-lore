"""Phase 3 — Cloud AI 100 client wiring for the /query route: reranks
candidates via cloud.reranker, attempts real generation via
cloud.inference.CloudAI100Client, and falls back to a deterministic
templated answer (Phase 2's original behavior) if that's unavailable —
which it always is until cloud/inference.py's CloudAI100Client is wired
up on-site to real hardware (see that module's docstring for why it's
intentionally left unimplemented here).

Input: a query string + its embedding + the top-k candidate chunk rows
from VectorStore.search().
Output: {"answer": str, "ranked_sources": list[dict]}.
Side effects: attempts to construct a CloudAI100Client and call it (a
real Cloud AI 100 hardware call, once wired); logs a warning and falls
back to a local templated answer if that fails, so /query keeps working
before real hardware is wired up.
